# Akurator
Application for controlling sound installations
(work in progress)

This will be the new control application replacing the Soundspace project. Important changes are:
* Platform independence (although Windows and MSVC is my preferred platform for development)
* Csound for sound playback and processing (through OSC - OpenSoundControl)
* Boost for logging and serialization
* Juce as GUI platform
