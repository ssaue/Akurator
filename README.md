# Akurator
Application for controlling sound installations
(work in progress)

This will be the new control application replacing the Soundspace project. Important changes are:
* Csound for sound playback and processing (through OSC - OpenSoundControl)
* Cereal for serialization (binary and XML, http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/)
* Juce as GUI platform
